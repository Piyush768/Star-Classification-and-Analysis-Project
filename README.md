**Title: Star Classification and Analysis using Machine Learning Models**

# Star Classification and Analysis Project

This project performs in-depth data analysis and classification on a dataset of celestial objects using various machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to classify celestial objects as stars, galaxies, or quasars based on specific attributes.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the characteristics of celestial objects and classify them accurately. We leverage several machine learning algorithms to achieve high classification accuracy, optimizing the model's performance with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The project also explores the distribution and correlation of features through visualization techniques.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and transformed features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted detailed analysis of feature distributions and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented multiple models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM for classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
